### **Fixed Issues**

- **Command Execution:**
  - Resolved issues with commands not working on my end.
  - The remote server provided by Ceph was malfunctioning.
  - Utilized `sudo` to execute the necessary commands successfully.

- **File Permissions:**
  - Encountered multiple file permission issues when running commands.
  - **Note:** `chmod` and `chown` commands were ineffective in resolving these issues.

### **Pending Tasks**

- **Incremental Builds:**
  - To be tested as it currently does not seem to work.

### **Setup Instructions**

#### **1. Install `ccache` (If Needed)**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ccache
```

#### **2. Configure CMake with `ccache` to Optimize Build Time**

```bash
sudo ./do_cmake.sh \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache
```

#### **3. Run Ninja Build Incrementally and Efficiently**

*Ensure you are in the build directory first:*

```bash
cd build
sudo ninja vstart-base cephfs cython_cephfs cython_rbd
```

#### **4. Set Up the Test Cluster as Usual**

```bash
sudo RGW=0 MDS=0 ../src/vstart.sh --debug --new -x --localhost --bluestore --without-dashboard
```

#### **5. Verify the Setup**

```bash
sudo ./bin/ceph -s
```

### **Collaboration Guidelines**

#### **After Rewriting History (Rebasing)**

*Perform the following **only** after rewriting history (rebasing):*

```bash
git fetch <Jun's fork>
git reset --hard <Jun's fork>/<project branch name>
```

#### **Otherwise**

*To incorporate your project mates' changes without overwriting your commits:*

```bash
git fetch <Jun's fork>
git pull <Jun's fork> <branch name> --rebase
```
